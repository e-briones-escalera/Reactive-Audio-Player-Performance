## Reactive-Audio-Player-Performance

This project is an experimental system designed to dynamically adapt the game's music and audio layers based on the player's performance. The idea is to make gameplay feel more immersive by rewarding accuracy, progress, or success with sound variations.  

For example:  
- When the player is performing well (hitting targets, making progress), the music can build up with more intense or uplifting layers.  
- When the player is struggling, the system can switch to darker tones or become floppy.

This kind of reactive audio system is commonly used in AAA games to reinforce player feedback and increase emotional engagement.  

## Features (Planned)  
- Real-time analysis of player performance metrics.  
- Adaptive music layering using Wwise
- Unreal Engine 5 integration with Blueprints.  
- Configurable parameters for designers (thresholds, layers, and events).  

## Status  
⚠️ **This project is currently in progress.**  
- There are no finalized files or media uploaded yet because the system is still in its early design stage.  
- As development progresses, I will be sharing commits and updates here! 

## Goals  
- Demonstrate technical sound design skills by building a fully functional audio-reactive system.  
- Provide a flexible framework that can be implemented in other projects.  

*Stay tuned! This repository will be updated with design diagrams, prototype videos, and source files as development advances.*
